## ü§ó Our Guiding Principles

We believe in growing our relationships with our team, our clients, and the community at large by fostering a culture of inclusivity, respect, and diversity, striving to lead by example with everything we do. Please read our [code of conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/)

### Getting Better Together

Our team values learning, teaching, and mentorship. We invest in each other and the people around us. We are a minority and women owned business. We value the differences and unique perspectives each of us bring to work every day. We celebrate and respect diversity by sharing our individual cultures and customs daily.

### Consistently Delivering Excellence

As technology partners, our integrated teams find ways to create better systems, processes, and help set standards that breed code quality, technical excellence, and a culture of mentorship. When working with external teams, we share our values through actions in hopes of creating a better working environment for others.

### Giving Back to the Community

We treat our clients and team members with the highest level of respect. We expect our team members to show the same degree of respect to each other that they would extend to our clients. We invest in historically underserved communities through our apprentice program, mentorship opportunities, and by inviting diverse voices to share their stories and work on our platforms.
